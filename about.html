    About Me:

I am a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a passion for technology and customer service. As an international student currently pursuing my studies at Swinburne University, I am committed to academic excellence and continuous learning. My experience in web development has equipped me with strong problem-solving skills and proficiency in various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have honed my communication and interpersonal skills through my background in customer service roles. I thrive in collaborative environments and am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to impactful projects. Outside of academics and work, I enjoy staying updated on the latest trends in technology and exploring new coding techniques. I am highly adaptable, detail-oriented, and driven to succeed in every endeavor I undertake.
